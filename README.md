# gender_by_mm
An experimentation on gender classification using neural network with keras

This is an experimentation of simple neural network in python.

- This algorithm takes dataset for training from file training_data.csv.
- Build model and save its structure and weights to json and h5py
- Predict output(Male|Female) based on new input
